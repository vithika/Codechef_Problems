Chef is a big fan of Coldplay. Every Sunday, he will drive to a park taking M minutes to reach there, and during the ride he will play a single song on a loop. Today, he has got the latest song which is in total S minutes long. He is interested to know how many times will he be able to play the song completely.

Input
The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M,S - the duration of the trip and the duration of the song, both in minutes.
Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.
