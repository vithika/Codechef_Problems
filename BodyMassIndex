You are given the height H (in metres) and mass M (in kilograms) of Chef. The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person is computed as MH2.

Report the category into which Chef falls, based on his BMI:

Category 1: Underweight if BMI ≤18
Category 2: Normal weight if BMI ∈{19, 20,…, 24}
Category 3: Overweight if BMI ∈{25, 26,…, 29}
Category 4: Obesity if BMI ≥30
Input:
The first line of input will contain an integer, T, which denotes the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, with two space separated integers, M,H, which denote the mass and height of Chef respectively.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, 1,2,3 or 4, based on the category in which Chef falls.

Constraints
1≤T≤2∗104
1≤M≤104
1≤H≤102
Its guaranteed that H2 divides M.
