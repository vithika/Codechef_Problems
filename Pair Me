Chef is always trying to find patterns within integers. Today Chef has 3 positive integers and he wonders if any one of them can be written as the sum of the other two integers.

Input:
First line will contain the number 5, which is the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, with three space-separated positive integers x, y, and z.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, "YES" if it's possible to represent any integer among the three integers as the sum of the other two integers, and "NO" if not.

NOTE: The output is case insensitive, meaning both uppercase and lowercase characters can be used at any position of the output string.

Sample Input:
5
1 1 2
1 3 2
2 2 2
100 100 201
11 22 33
Sample Output:
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int t;
    int x,y,z;
    scanf("%d",&t);
    while(t--)
    {
   
    scanf("%d%d%d",&x,&y,&z);
    if(x+y==z)
    {
        printf("YES\n");
    }
    else if(y+z==x)
    {
        printf("YES\n");
    }
    else if(x+z==y)
    {
      printf("YES\n");   
    }
    else
    {
        printf("NO\n");
    }
}
	return 0;
}
