There are N integers in an array A.

Two players take turns alternatively in placing signs (+ or -) before them, and then they all are added. The sign can be placed before any element of the array that has not been assigned a sign yet. All elements must be assigned a sign.

Player 1 wins if the resulting sum is even, else player 2 wins. Find out who shall win if they both play optimally.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains 2 lines of input.
First line contains a single integer N, size of the array.
Second line contains N space separated integers - A1,A2,…,AN, denoting the array elements.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "1", if the first person wins or "2" if the second person wins.
