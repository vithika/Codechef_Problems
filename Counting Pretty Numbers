Vasya likes the number 239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 2, 3 or 9.

Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pretty numbers between L and R.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤L≤R≤105
Subtasks

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
     int t,l,r,i;
   scanf("%d\n",&t);
    while(t--)
    {
        int count=0;
        scanf("%d%d",&l,&r);
        for(i=l;i<=r;i++)
        {
            if((i%10==2)||(i%10==3)||(i%10==9))
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n",count);
    }
 
	// your code goes here
	return 0;
}
