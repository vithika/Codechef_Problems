The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

Example
Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4

// Note that this problem is for testing fast input-output.
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() {
	// Read the input n, k
	int n, k;
	scanf("%d %d", &n, &k);

	// ans denotes number of integers n divisible by k
	int ans = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int t[n];
		scanf("%d", &t[i]);
		
		if (t[i] % k == 0) {
			ans++;
		}		
	}

	// Print the ans.
	printf("%d\n", ans);
	
	return 0;
}
