Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in x units of time, he finishes it in m∗x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max d units of time. Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x,m,d.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Constraints
1≤T≤104
1≤x,m≤10
0≤d<100
Sample Input:
3
1 1 0
1 3 1
2 2 3
Sample Output:
